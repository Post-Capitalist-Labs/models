# Code Review for `council_economy.py`

## Overview
The provided Python code for a Mesa simulation model, `council_economy.py`, contains several classes and methods for simulating an economy with workers' and consumers' councils. Below are suggestions and improvements for enhancing the code.

## Suggestions for Improvements

### Modularity and Readability
- Break down large methods into smaller ones to improve readability and maintainability.
- Example: Split `adjust_proposal` in `CouncilAgent` into smaller, focused methods.

### Method `calculate_global_average_plan`
- Currently prints an error and returns a dummy value. Needs proper implementation or removal.
- Consider making `CouncilAgent` an abstract base class with `calculate_global_average_plan` as an abstract method for derived classes.

### Efficient Data Handling
- Lists like `encountered_proposals` and `proposal_history` could become inefficient. Consider size limits or alternative data structures.

### Use of Randomness
- Frequent use of `random.randint` and `random.choice` may lead to high variability in simulation outcomes.
- Provide a way to set a random seed for reproducibility.

### Magic Numbers
- Define magic numbers (e.g., `0.8`, `400`) as named constants for better readability and easier modifications.

### Error Handling
- Ensure methods like `teleport_if_unmatched` have safeguards against potential errors (e.g., grid boundaries).

### Logging Instead of Printing
- Use Python's logging module instead of `print` statements for better output control and flexibility.

### Documentation
- Add docstrings to classes and methods for clarity on their purpose, parameters, and return values.

### Performance Considerations
- Be mindful of performance, especially with larger grids or many agents. Profiling can help identify performance bottlenecks.

### Code Organization
- Group related methods and properties together for better code structure. Example: place all property definitions at the top of a class.

## Conclusion
The code is well-structured and adheres to object-oriented programming principles. The above suggestions aim to enhance its quality, maintainability, and performance.
