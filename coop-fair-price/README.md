# Equitable Pricing Formula in a Cooperative Economy

Here we modedl an equitable pricing formula in an economy of cooperatives. This formula will redistribute surplus from more economically advantaged co-ops to less advantaged ones to maintain balance and sustainability within the cooperative community.

## Definitions

Before we construct the formula, let's define some terms:

- `C_p`: The production cost of a good or service for a particular co-op.
- `P_m`: The market price for the good or service in a competitive market without equity adjustments.
- `S`: The surplus generated from the exchange, calculated as `P_m - C_p`.
- `REA%`: The Relative Economic Advantage percentage. A value of 100% means no advantage or disadvantage, values above 100% indicate an advantage, and below 100% indicate a disadvantage.
- `α (alpha)`: A redistribution rate that determines the portion of the surplus to be redistributed. It could be a fixed value or variable depending on `REA%`. [See options being considered for calculating alpha.](https://github.com/Post-Capitalist-Labs/models/blob/main/coop-fair-price/calculate_alpha.md)
- `E`: The equity adjustment amount to be added or subtracted from the market price for the disadvantaged or advantaged co-op, respectively.

## The Formula

The equitable price `P_e` for a good or service sold by a co-op is calculated as follows:

`P_e = P_m + E`

Where `E` is determined by the co-op's `REA%`:
```
E = {
(S * α) if REA% < 100
-(S * α) if REA% > 100
0 if REA% = 100
}
```

- Co-ops with `REA% < 100` will charge a higher price to receive additional support.
- Co-ops with `REA% > 100` will reduce their price to redistribute their economic benefits.
- Co-ops with `REA% = 100` will charge the market price `P_m`.

The `α (alpha)` could be a fixed rate (e.g., 10%) or a sliding scale that increases as `REA%` decreases, providing more support to those more disadvantaged.

## Model Implementation

To simulate this formula, we build an agent-based model using the Mesa framework in Python, with the following components:

- **Agents**: Representing the co-op enterprises.
- **Market**: Mechanism for transactions.
- **Scheduler**: To control the sequence of events.
- **DataCollector**: For data gathering and reporting.

The simulation allows us to analyze the effects of the equitable pricing formula under various scenarios and conditions within the cooperative economy.

## Conclusion

This pricing formula and simulation model serve as a foundational approach to fostering equity within a cooperative economic system. It ensures that all members of the community, regardless of their economic standing, can participate and thrive.
