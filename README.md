## Welcome to the Post-Capitalist Models Repository

In this repository, we are dedicated to building an expansive library of models focused on critically exploring the assumptions of post-capitalism. Our goal is to leverage these insights in the development of innovative cryptoeconomic designs, advanced smart contract engineering, and novel protocol architectures.

## Purpose and Scope
Our collection of models serves as a tool for intellectual exploration, aiding in the validation and challenge of various hypotheses within the realm of post-capitalist thought. These models, although not capable of perfectly simulating real-world scenarios, are instrumental in uncovering critical issues and testing theoretical constructs.

## Model Framework and Usage
Each model in this repository is crafted using the Mesa framework, a popular agent-based modeling system, implemented in Python. This choice allows for a blend of flexibility and power in modeling complex systems. For each model, you will find a dedicated README.me file within its repository. These files offer a comprehensive overview of the model's attributes and provide detailed instructions on usage.

## Understanding Model Limitations
It is crucial to recognize that while our models are sophisticated tools, they cannot fully replicate the intricacies of real-life systems. They are, however, invaluable in offering insights and highlighting potential areas of concern or interest in the study of post-capitalist systems.

## Latest Model Releases
Below, you will find a list of our latest model releases, each accompanied by a brief description to help you identify the models most relevant to your research and interests.
