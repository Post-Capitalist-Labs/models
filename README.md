 A simple council-based economy model comprising worker and consumer councils. Each council will make proposals regarding production and consumption, and the model will iterate these proposals until a balance is achieved between supply and demand. We'll set up 100 workers' councils and 100 consumers' councils as specified.

- **WorkersCouncilAgent** and **ConsumersCouncilAgent**:
  - Each starts with a random initial proposal for production and consumption, respectively.
- **Adjustment Process**:
  - In each step, agents adjust their plans based on simplified logic, such as random adjustments in this example.
  - For a more detailed model, adjustments would involve complex interactions based on actual economic factors.
- **Model Execution**:
  - The model runs for a specified number of steps.
  - After each step, it prints the total production and consumption across all councils.
  - In a more complex version, the iteration would continue until the total production closely matches the total consumption.
- **Framework and Realism**:
  - This code serves as a foundational framework.
  - To enhance realism, detailed mechanisms for proposal adjustment based on feedback from the other type of council need to be implemented.
- **Mesa Model and Future Development**:
  - This Mesa model provides a basic simulation of the proposed council-based economy.
  - It allows for further complexity and detail to be added as needed.
