# Modeling Direct Democracy and the Tragedy of the Commons

## Overview
This project aims to explore the efficacy of direct democracy in managing common resources, addressing the classic problem known as the Tragedy of the Commons. Through a series of increasingly complex simulations, we will investigate how communal or no ownership models, regulated through direct democratic processes, impact the sustainability of common resources.

## Roadmap

### Version 0.0x: Basic Direct Democracy Model

#### Objective
To create a foundational model that simulates the basic dynamics of a community engaging in direct democracy to manage a single, shared resource.

#### Features
- **Simple Agents**: Agents with basic attributes such as resource usage rate and a binary opinion on resource management.
- **Unified Commons**: A single, non-spatially distributed resource that agents collectively use and manage.
- **Basic Voting Mechanism**: A simple voting process where agents periodically decide on resource usage limits.

#### Expected Outcomes
To understand the baseline ability of a direct democracy model to prevent resource depletion in a highly simplified context.

### Version 0.0x1: Enhanced Decision-Making and Agent Complexity

#### Objective
To introduce more realistic and complex agent behaviors and a detailed decision-making process, including debate and opinion formation.

#### Features
- **Complex Agents**: Introduction of diverse opinions, strategies, and a reputation system.
- **Advanced Voting Mechanism**: Agents can propose and vote on multiple management strategies, influenced by interactive debates.
- **Environmental Dynamics**: Introduction of basic environmental changes to test the resilience of community decisions.

#### Expected Outcomes
To analyze how enhanced agent interactions and more complex decision-making processes impact the sustainability of commons.

### Version 0.0x2: Spatial Dynamics and Resource Complexity

#### Objective
To add spatial dynamics to the commons and diversify the types of resources, simulating more realistic environmental conditions.

#### Features
- **Spatial Environment**: A grid-based model where location influences resource usage and regeneration.
- **Multiple Resources**: Introduction of different resource types, each with unique dynamics.
- **Temporal Changes**: Simulating environmental shocks and changes over time to test community adaptability.

#### Expected Outcomes
To explore how spatial and temporal complexities, alongside resource diversity, affect communal management under direct democracy.

### Version 0.0x3: Inter-Community Dynamics

#### Objective
To simulate interactions between multiple communities managing adjacent commons, exploring the effects of cooperation, conflict, and trade.

#### Features
- **Multiple Communities**: Introduction of adjacent communities with their resources and democratic processes.
- **Inter-Community Interactions**: Mechanisms for trade, treaties, and conflict over resource management.
- **Comprehensive Analysis Tools**: Enhanced data collection and analysis features to study inter-community dynamics.

#### Expected Outcomes
To understand the broader implications of direct democracy in commons management, including the potential for cooperation or conflict between communities.
